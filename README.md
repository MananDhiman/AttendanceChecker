## How the App Works
* The main screen has two main buttons "Present", "Absent"
* Clicking any of these buttons saves the changes to the database and updates the percentage in the textView
* The upper two buttons are used to switch between marking "New Attendance" and viewing previous attendance "Attendance History"
* Clicking "Attendance History" displays all previous records in a RecyclerView list
